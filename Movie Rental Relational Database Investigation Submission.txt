-- Ques #1 We want to understand more about the movies that families are watching. 
-- The following categories are considered family movies: Animation, Children, Classics, Comedy, Family and Music.
-- Create a query that lists each movie, the film category it is classified in, and the number of times it has been rented out.

SELECT film_title,
    category_name,
    COUNT(*) rental_count
FROM
    (SELECT f.title film_title,
        c.name category_name,
        r.rental_id rental_id
    FROM film f 
    JOIN film_category fc 
    ON f.film_id = fc.film_id
    JOIN category c 
    ON fc.category_id = c.category_id 
    JOIN inventory i 
    ON f.film_id = i.film_id
    JOIN rental r 
    ON i.inventory_id = r.inventory_id) t1
WHERE category_name IN ('Animation', 'Children', 'Classics', 'Comedy', 'Family', 'Music')
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 2, 1

-- Ques #2 Now we need to know how the length of rental duration of these family-friendly movies compares 
-- to the duration that all movies are rented for. Can you provide a table with the movie titles and divide 
-- them into 4 levels (first_quarter, second_quarter, third_quarter, and final_quarter) based on the quartiles 
-- (25%, 50%, 75%) of the average rental duration(in the number of days) for movies across all categories? 
-- Make sure to also indicate the category that these family-friendly movies fall into.

;

-- Ques #3 Provide a table with the family-friendly film category, each of the quartiles, and the 
-- corresponding count of movies within each combination of film category for each corresponding rental 
-- duration category. The resulting table should have three columns:
-- Category
-- Rental length category
-- Count
